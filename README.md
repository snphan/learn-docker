# Learning Docker Notes

# 01 - What is Docker?

## What is a container?
- A way to package an application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration
- Containers live on a container repository
- We can also use docker hub for a bunch of containers such as mongoDB, nginx, redis. 

## How do containers help application development.
- Before: we would need to install all of the services for each developer. 
    - There were many steps and a lot could go wrong.

- Now: with the containers, you don't need to install any of the binaries. 
- Configurations, startscript and a service (such as postgres) can be run with one command
